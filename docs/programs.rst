Special Program/File Considerations
=====

Programs with large or multiple project files
------------
*Note - When a cloud storage account is connected any file you work on is directly synchronized with the Cloud.*

If you work on a single Excel or text file performance shouldnâ€™t be impacted. However, if you open or save big projects that contain multiple files, libraries, segments or if the file sizes are excessive it might take a lot longer or even time out when try to Build projects or save big catalogs. 

In these cases we suggest the following workflow:

1. Copy the files from your Google/OneDrive to your Temporary folder and then open

2. Once you are done with your work save and copy the files back from Temporary files to your Google/OneDrive

    .. image:: _static/temp_to_cloud.png

3. Wait for a few minutes to allow those files to be uploaded to your Cloud location before terminating your AppStream session
